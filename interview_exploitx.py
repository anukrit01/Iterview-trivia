'''
You are given a list of intervals, return the sum of all the
interval lengths. Overlapping intervals should only be counted once.

Sample Input: [(1,4),
               (7,10),
               (3,5)]

Sample Output: The sum of the lengths of these intervals is 7.

Since (1,4) and (3,5) overlap, we can treat the interval as 
(1,5), which has a length of 4.
